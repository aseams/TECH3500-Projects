## Project #1

- <a href="https://github.com/aseams/TECH3500-Project1" target="_blank">Monty Hall Problem</a>

<b>Description:</b> The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based off the gameshow “Let’s Make a Deal”. In this gameshow, the contestant will choose one of three doors (which either conceal a prize or a goat), the host will reveal what is behind a different door, and then the contestant will have the option to switch doors. I tested whether or not it's beneficial to always switch doors after seeing a goat behind another door. The following diagram explains the concept of the problem:
